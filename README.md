Intro from Ryan
===

This project is my first attempt at using Next.js with Vercel and a Neon database for deployment.

I gathered data from free Harry Potter APIs online, and seeded the data to my Neon database to be used in the project, as to not exceed API request limits during development. I also wanted to learn how to setup a deployment with Vercel/Neon as opposed to making my calls to an external API... but still wanted to fun of using Harry Potter data!

The goal was to become familiar with project setup, routing, and writing database requests using Next.js. This may not be the cleanest and most eloquent way of doing things, but as a first attempt it is all about the learning process! Lots of trial and error, reading docs, and watching videos.

I also am using Tailwind CSS in this project, as it seems to be a commonly preferred method of styling Next.js applications. I have used Tailwind CSS in the past, however there is a bit of a learning curve in efficiency due to not having a ton of their style shorthand committed to memory. Another reason this project has been a great growth opportunity for me!


## Getting Started - from Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
