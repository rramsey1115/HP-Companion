# **Harry Potter Companion App**  

### **Overview**  
This project is my **first attempt at using Next.js with Vercel and a Neon database** for deployment. The goal was to **learn full-stack development** with Next.js, Drizzle ORM, and serverless databases while working with **Harry Potter data**.  

### **Tech Stack**
- **Next.js** – Full-stack framework for React  
- **Vercel** – Deployment platform  
- **Neon** – Serverless PostgreSQL database  
- **Drizzle ORM** – For schema setup, migrations, seeding, and API queries  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling  

### **Data Source & API Usage**  
I initially gathered data from **free Harry Potter APIs**, but to avoid exceeding API request limits during development, I **seeded the data into my Neon database**. This also gave me the chance to practice database design and API development.  

### **Project Goals**  
This project helped me:  
✅ Learn **Next.js** project setup and routing  
✅ Work with **Neon/PostgreSQL** instead of relying on an external API  
✅ Practice **Drizzle ORM** for querying and API endpoint creation  
✅ Improve **Tailwind CSS** efficiency and shorthand usage  

### **Final Thoughts**  
This may not be the most **optimized or polished** project yet, but it's been a fantastic **learning experience**. It involved **lots of trial and error**, reading documentation, and watching tutorials. I'm excited to continue refining it!

## Getting Started - startup instructions from Next

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
